# Introduction

> Beautifully designed, easily copy & pastable, fully customizable - that means it only depends on few dependencies.

This is **UI kit**, a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
This UI kit is inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - but it is more customizable.

**More customizable?**

shadcn/ui depends on a lot of packages to provide functionality to its components.
Radix UI, React DayPicker, Embla Carousel...

I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

But when you depends on a lot of package - you easily mess up your package.json, and you can't even edit a single feature.
The only thing you can customize is **style**.

If there's a bug that needs to be fixed quickly, or a feature that doesn't work the way you want it to, 
you'll want to tweak it to your liking. This is where relying on a lot of packages can be poison.

PSW/UI solves this - by **NOT** depending on any other packages than framework like React, TailwindCSS, and tailwind-merge.

You can just copy it, and all functionality is contained in a single file.

# Roadmap

First of all, this project is alpha.

You can see a lot of components are missing, and some component is buggy.

I'm working with this priority:

1. Adding new component, with stable features.
2. Fixing bugs with existing components.
3. Make it looks nice.

Also, there is a [Github README](https://github.com/p-sw/ui) for component implementation plans.

You can see what component is implemented, or planned to be implemented.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know in [Github Issues](https://github.com/p-sw/ui/issues).
